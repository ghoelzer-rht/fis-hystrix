== Lab Guide - Deploying a Microservice Gateway using Kubeflix & Hysterix

In this lab, we will create a Gateway Microservice Pattern implementation of a simple Dictionary Definition service using the Kubeflix API Implementation for Service Discovery and Routing.  Additionally, we will use Hysterix for Microservice monitoring and implementation of a Circuit Breaker pattern.  The Microservice implementations are using Red Hat Fuse Integration Services (FIS) 2.0, and use relatively simple REST and Java DSL, along with Java POJO and Service implementations.  FIS 2.0 is an integrated Java Framework that's highly suitable for Microservice implementations, and focused on real-time/event-driven integration patterns.  For more background on all the FIS 2.0 capabilities see - https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/02/21/announcing-fuse-for-agile-integration-on-the-cloud-fis-2-0-release/

== Deploy Base Microservices to OpenShift

1. Login to the remote OpenShift environment (Get instructions from your OpenShift admin)

1. Create a new project with a unique name or ensure an existing OpenShift project is selected 
+
    oc new-project fis-hysterix-<unique number>
    or
    oc project <your-project-name>

1. From the base of where you cloned your git repo, execute the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc process -f support/templates/gateway.json | oc create -f-

oc process -f support/templates/definition.json | oc create -f-
----
From the OpenShift Web Console, select the project you have created or are using.  You should see that two s2i builds have kicked-off for the *gateway* and *definition components*, which will deploy when complete as shown below:

1. Build and deploy your project
+
    mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift

== Verify Deployment and Application within OpenShift

1. Login to the OpenShift Web Console (Get URL from your OpenShift admin)

1. From the Web Console Home Page, scroll down and select the Project used for this Lab

1. From the Overview Page of your Project, you should see the following Applications and Components running once they have completed deployment:
+

1. Within the *product-catalog* application, open the URL from the created *Route* in another browser tab and verify the Spring application is working:
